# coloriage_automatique_nsi_terminale
This is my first term project of NSI (a course subject in high school (I don't know if it exist in other countrys or what's the name of this course)), and it's a paint bucket (like paint), i got 20/20 at this project with one friend.

I did that with tkinter and PILLOW for all the picture.
